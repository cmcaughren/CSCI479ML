## Problem Description:
   In the csv file Points.csv, each line represents one data point in a three dimensional space, 
   where ID is an artificial id of the data point, and A, B, C represent the data item's position 
   in the three dimensions respectively. There are altogether 50 data points collected in the file.

   These data points don't have class labels. But it is necessary to classify these data points 
   into two classes and to assign a target class label to each data point.

   Your tasks:

   Write a program that implements K-Means algorithm to cluster the data points given in the 
   file into two clusters.

   The basic K-Means algorithm is shown below:

   Select K points as the initial centroids;
   repeat
       Form K clusters by assigning all points to the closest centroid;
       Recompute the centroid of each cluster;
   until the centroids don't change
   Your program should set the K as a constant and set K's value as 2 for this application 
   specifically. Your program should use Euclidean distance as the distance function for this
    application.

   Just in case this application runs too long to find stable centroids, you can set a constant
    N (to a relatively not too small number) and change the terminate condition to "until the 
    centroids don't change or N repetitions are done".

   At the end of the execution, your program should output the coordinates (values of A, B and C) 
   of the two final centroids and the modified data points (including the original data points 
   and their corresponding assigned class labels) to a file called result.txt. The format of the 
   data in result.txt should be user friendly. You can choose your own class label representations,
    or simply use C1 and C2 as the two class labels.



## How to compile and run the program
   To run the program and populate result.txt file, please enter:
      'python3 A5.py Points.csv'
   or substitute whatever path locations are needed for the data set.

## Results

   Final results of the K-Means Algorithm clustering is found in results.txt 

   After running the program multiple times, the same final centroids are found over and over:
      Final C1 centroid = [5.32, 10.36, 14.2]
      Final C2 centroid = [11.84, 3.04, 4.6]
   Though the program was given up to N = 100 iterations to settle into final centroids, 
   this final set is usually found within the first 4 iterations.

##Notes for Marker
   Centroids are recalculated each iteration by finding the average A, B, C coordinates
   of all of the points within that centroids label Category (C1 or C2).
   This is done by summing the A, B or C coordinates as each point is iterated over
   when calculating distances to determine the label.
   Initial centroids are randomly selected from all the points in the data set.
   Euclidean Distance was used to calculate distance between the centroids and each point.
